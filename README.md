# Poisson Distribution 🎲📊

This project demonstrates how to work with the Poisson distribution using Python. It models the probability of a given number of events occurring in a fixed interval of time or space, given a constant mean rate.

## 📂 Files

The project contains a Jupyter notebook file:

- `Poission_Distribution.ipynb`: The main notebook that demonstrates the creation and visualization of Poisson-distributed random variables.

## 📦 Requirements

To run the code, you will need to install the following Python libraries:

- `numpy`: For numerical operations and generating random numbers. ⚙️
- `matplotlib`: For visualizing the distribution in the form of plots. 📈
- `scipy`: For statistical functions and distribution tools. 🔬

You can install the necessary libraries with:

```bash
pip install numpy matplotlib scipy
```

## 📝 Description
1. **Poisson Distribution**: Understanding the behavior of a random variable representing the number of events occurring in a fixed interval.
2. **Visualization**: A histogram comparing the observed distribution with the theoretical Poisson PMF.
3. **Mean and Variance**: Calculating and comparing theoretical vs. empirical values of the mean and variance.
4. **Real-World Applications**: Examples such as modeling customer arrivals, system failures, and rare event occurrences.
   
## 📊 Usage
Run the `Poisson_Distribution.ipynb` file to visualize and analyze the Poisson distribution. It includes plots and explanations to help understand the concept intuitively.
